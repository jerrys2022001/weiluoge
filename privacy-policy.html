        <p>To provide our cleanup and organization services, the App needs access to your photo library, contact list, and optionally your Gmail account. The app requires that you expressly allow this access, through a request appearing on your mobile device.</p>
        
        <h4>2.1. Data we receive directly from you</h4>
        
        <h4>2.1.1. Identifiers</h4>

        <p>a) we will only use access to read or control Gmail message metadata (including information about attachments), headers and message content to provide a service that allows users to process (delete/move/archive) emails and will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary to comply with applicable law.</p>
        <p>b) we will not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements.</p>
        <p>c) we will not allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement for specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, or to comply with applicable law.</p>

        <p>This helps us to better understand our business, analyze our operations, maintain, improve, innovate, plan, design, and develop the App and our new products. We also use such data for statistical analysis purposes, to test and improve our offers. This enables us to better understand what features and sections of the App our users like more, what categories of users use our App. As a consequence, we often decide how to improve the App based on the results obtained from this processing.</p>

        <p>We will not store or collect your payment card details ourselves. This information will be provided directly to Apple's payment processors.</p>
        
        <h4>3.7. To enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use and to prevent and combat fraud</h4>
        <p>We use personal data to enforce our agreements and contractual commitments, to detect, prevent, and combat fraud.
